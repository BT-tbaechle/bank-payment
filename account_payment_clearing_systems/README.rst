=======================================
Account Payment Clearing Systems Module
=======================================

This module allows to set a 'Clearing System Member Identification' type on a bank (res.bank) and
provide a Clearing System Member Identification Number which is needed for banks that don't have a
Bank Identifier Code (BIC) to generate a PAIN (payment instruction) file that can be used for international
payments.

The module was built using the specifications listed here: https://www.iso20022.org/external_code_list.page

Installation
============

This module depends on:

- account_banking_pain_base

This module is part of the OCA/bank-payment suite.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to Sales > Configuration > Banks.
#. For all the banks that don't have a Bank Identifier Code (BIC) set the appropriate
   Clearing System Member Identification (CSMI) and the country.
#. Set a Clearing System Member Identification Number that is valid for the chosen CSMI.

(Now if you generate a PAIN file from a payment order with a payment to one of those banks
the payment instruction will have the appropriate target information.)

Usage
=====

See 'readme' files of the OCA/bank-payment suite.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * Unfortunately at this point in time in Germany it is not possible to make a payment to a
bank account without an IBAN using a PAIN file (this is due to the PAIN variant that they use).
